# 2023-R-Final-Assignment

This repository contains the R scripts and workdata for my 2023 final assignment for R class.

## Data

The workdata used in this project includes NHS data of Nepal and accessibility_to_cities grid data of Nepal.

The NHS data of Nepal provides information on the reproductive health status of women in Nepal. The data covers various indicators such as maternal health, family planning, and health service utilization.

The accessibility_to_cities grid data measures the travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre. The data is based on an integration of global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and high-density urban centres. The data can be used to assess inequalities in accessibility and to inform the design and implementation of development policies .

## Usage

To use the code and data in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and open the R files in your preferred R development environment.
